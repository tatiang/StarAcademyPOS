v1.29

Login screen looks correct
  • No more connecting to database delays
Didn't save any of the previous AI-generated item images I had saved in an earlier version
  • Do these get stored in Firestore Database? 
    • Seems to work okay now...?
When adding or changing an item image, especially when generating AI image, it should show a status such as a green/yellow light or "generating..." so you know it's working on it
  • Add a download button or an upload to GitHub button so I can save generated images
  • If not GitHub then maybe Cloudinary?
Inventory screen
  • Add small thumbnail image for each item
