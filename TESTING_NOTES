v1.29 (now the "definitive" version for Gemini)
######
Login screen looks correct
  • No more connecting to database delays
POS screen
  • It should sync image urls from Firestore. Right now, it seems like it's not saving them in the app but I do see them in Firestore. It just doesn't retrieve them.

Didn't save any of the previous AI-generated item images I had saved in an earlier version
  • Do these get stored in Firestore Database? 
    • Seems to work okay now...?
When adding or changing an item image, especially when generating AI image, it should show a status such as a green/yellow light or "generating..." so you know it's working on it
  • Add a download button or an upload to GitHub button so I can save generated images
  • If not GitHub then maybe Cloudinary?
Inventory screen
  • Add small thumbnail image for each item
  • Items should be sortable by each header
  • Categories should have emojis or symbols
Manager Hub screen
  • Add ability to report bug or feature suggestion
  • Add ability to add/edit/delete employees
  • Other recommended functionality for this screen
Can error messages (such as clocking in/out without selecting a student's name) have a different dialog title than "tatiang.github.io says"?
  • This appears to be fixed in v1.34
All times should be in HH:MM format
  • This appears to be fixed in v1.34
IT Hub screen
  • Embed TESTING_NOTES from Github's /TESTING_NOTES file
    • This appears to be included in v1.34
  • Expandable list of current features, known bugs, potential future improvements
    • This appears to be included in v1.34
